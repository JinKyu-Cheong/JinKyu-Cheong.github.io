Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has transformed cancer treatment, but up to 40%
of patients develop immune-related adverse events such as colitis.

My ongoing research investigates whether pre-existing epigenetic states in HSPCs can predict
susceptibility to ICI-associated colitis. By integrating longitudinal patient cohorts,
single-cell multi-omics, and murine models, I aim to define how interferon-driven
hematopoietic memory reprograms both immune and epithelial compartments.

A key goal is understanding how therapeutic interventions remodel these programs while
preserving anti-tumor immunity.
