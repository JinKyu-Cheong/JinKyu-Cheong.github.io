Severe infections can leave lasting imprints on the immune system beyond adaptive immunity.
During my Ph.D., I discovered that severe COVID-19 establishes durable epigenetic and
transcriptional changes in HSPCs that persist for months to over a year post-infection.

Using single-cell multi-omic profiling (ATAC-seq + RNA-seq), I characterized how bone marrow
progenitors undergo chromatin remodeling that is conveyed to differentiated monocytes,
contributing to prolonged inflammatory phenotypes. I developed the **PBMC-PIE**
(Progenitor Input Enrichment) workflow to analyze rare circulating HSPCs from standard blood
draws, enabling non-invasive study of hematopoietic reprogramming in human patients.
