Building on the framework of durable hematopoietic reprogramming, my current work
investigates how chronic intestinal inflammation rewires the bone marrow compartment.

Using high-resolution single-cell multi-omic atlases of circulating HSPCs and their
mature progeny in Crohn's disease, I uncovered that inflammatory signals from the gut
drive coordinated epigenetic and transcriptional changes across the hematopoietic
hierarchy — from stem cells through committed progenitors to mature monocytes.

Using bone marrow chimera models, I demonstrated that colitis-primed progenitors
autonomously amplify pathogenic inflammation, and that anti-TNF therapy can normalize
these altered programs.
