    bio: >
      I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the lab of Dr. Rachel Niec at Memorial
      Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. My research investigates how epigenetic mechanisms
      shape innate immune memory, with a focus on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells
      (HSPCs) in the context of inflammation and tissue microenvironments.
      During my Ph.D. with Dr. Steven Josefowicz at Weill Cornell Medicine, I uncovered
      epigenetic reprogramming of innate immune cells and their bone marrow progenitors
      following severe COVID-19 infection, published in *Cell* (2023). I developed the
      PBMC-PIE workflow to analyze rare circulating HSPCs from human blood, enabling
      new insights into how systemic inflammation imprints lasting changes on immune
      cell development.
